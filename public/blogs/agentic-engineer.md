Artificial intelligence is profoundly transforming the developer profession. Among the most striking evolutions of 2024-2025, a new profile is emerging: the **agentic engineer**. But what exactly is an agentic engineer, and how does it differ from a traditional developer?

## A New Way of Conceiving Code

Traditionally, a developer writes code line by line, tests, debugs, and maintains their applications. The agentic engineer, however, adopts a radically different approach: they orchestrate autonomous AI agents that generate, test, and deploy code for them.

Concretely, rather than manually writing a function or module, the agentic engineer defines the objectives, constraints, and context, then delegates implementation to specialized AI agents. Their role becomes that of an architect and supervisor rather than an executor.

## Key Skills of an Agentic Engineer

This new profession requires a hybrid set of skills blending technical expertise and AI mastery. A good agentic engineer must know how to design effective prompts to guide AI agents, understand the capabilities and limitations of language models, architect systems where humans and AI collaborate seamlessly, and maintain rigorous quality control over automatically generated code.

The ability to decompose complex problems into tasks that agents can accomplish autonomously becomes a fundamental skill, as does understanding concepts of *prompt engineering*, *chain-of-thought*, and techniques for iterative improvement of results.

## The Agentic Engineer's Tools

Several tools have emerged to facilitate this new way of working. Platforms like Claude Code allow delegating development tasks directly from the terminal. Agent orchestration frameworks like AutoGPT, LangChain, or proprietary solutions enable the creation of automated workflows. Augmented IDEs now integrate AI assistants capable of generating contextual code.

These tools transform the development environment into a collaborative space where humans define the strategic vision and AI executes repetitive technical tasks.

## Advantages and Challenges of This Approach

The agentic approach offers spectacular productivity gains, particularly on repetitive tasks, boilerplate code, or the implementation of standard patterns. It also allows developers to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of their work, where human intelligence adds the most value.

However, this new way of working also poses significant challenges. The quality of generated code must be constantly verified, security and compliance with standards must be guaranteed, and developers must learn to trust automated systems while maintaining critical vigilance. There is also a risk of over-reliance on AI tools, which could erode certain fundamental technical skills.

## The Future of Software Development

The agentic engineer is not destined to replace the traditional developer, but rather represents a natural evolution of the profession. Just as IDEs, frameworks, and libraries have transformed programming over the decades, AI agents represent the next layer of abstraction.

In the near future, it is likely that most developers will adopt a hybrid approach, alternating between manual coding for critical or innovative parts, and agent orchestration for more standardized tasks. The true value of a developer will reside more and more in their ability to design robust architectures, make informed technical decisions, and maintain a holistic view of the systems they build.

## Conclusion

The agentic engineer embodies a profound transformation of the developer profession in the AI era. This profile requires not only solid technical skills but also an ability to collaborate effectively with intelligent systems. For current developers, it is an invitation to develop new skills and rethink their role in the software creation chain. The future belongs to those who can leverage AI as an amplifier of their capabilities, while retaining the critical judgment and creativity that form the essence of the profession.
